                                I directed over 250 hours of one-on-one tutoring
                                sessions where I assisted beginner programers by debugging
                                their Python code, explaining programming concepts,
                                and conducting demonstrations. I assited over 100
                                students and tracked their progress on course mastery
                                through follow-up discussions as needed. I exhibited
                                exceptional time management to help as many people
                                as possible as well as flexibility in being frequently
                                available outside of office hours. While this role was
                                exhausting at times, I found it very rewarding to give
                                back to my community. I was in these students' shoes
                                early in my academic career, so I know very well that
                                having the right guidance on can make a huge difference.
                                I truly enjoyed having a meaningful, positive impact on
                                these students, and I am honored that I could be a part
                                of their academic journeys.

                            I was curious about electric vehicles due to some
                            recent conversations with relatives. I wanted to
                            determine which brands were most popular/successful
                            and found a dataset on Kaggle that fit my needs.
                            While it had 5000+ relevant entries, it required a
                            great deal of cleaning (converting data, trimming,
                            removing junk characters, creating calculated fields,
                            etc.), which I did through Excel and PostgreSQL.
                            I then used this data to answer inquiries on quarterly
                            sales between 2012 and 2019, which can be seen in
                            ev_sales.sql. A visualization of actual EV sales compared
                            to expected EV sales for the top ten best-selling brands
                            can be seen on Tableau. In the future, I would like to
                            explore brand popularity by customer demographics and
                            compare EV sales to non-EV sales from the same make.

                            I cleaned data on 7000+ films and conducted
                            exploratory analysis using Python's Matplotlib,
                            Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn. Using the Pearson
                            method, I found a positive correlation of 0.74
                            between movie budget and gross revenue.
                            I also created a correlation matrix in the
                            form of a heatmap to visualize this relationship in
                            addition to other relationships between different
                            movie features. This matrix further shows the strong
                            correlation betweewn budget and revenue.

                            I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and wanted to
                            learn more about the prevalence of thyroid conditions
                            and treatment options across people of different
                            backgrounds. I came across a Kaggle dataset with
                            relevant information, and though it was meant for
                            machine learning projects, I deemed it as a good
                            starting place for my own purpose. From the 9000+
                            patient entries in this dataset, I identified and
                            removed "normal function" patients and cleaned the
                            remaining entries (removed outliers, created calculated
                            fields, converted data, etc.) using PostgreSQL.
                            I then constructed an interactive dashboard on Tableau
                            to visualize my data by age, sex, and treatment option.
                            I found that adult women are most affected and that
                            medication is the most common treatment option.

                            visualizes its sales by customer demographics.
                            I cleaned data on 1000+ sales, created pivot

                            My four teammates and I saw the need
                            for a free, interactive study tool that
                            would assist students like us. Our project
                            allows users to create flashcards, view
                            other users’ flashcards, and play a quizzing game.
                            Flashcards are contained in sets, multiple sets are contained
                            in a chapter, and multiple chapters are
                            contained in a course. I worked on both the
                            frontend and backend of this project using
                            React, Node, and PostgreSQL. More specifically,
                            I developed the sidebar, search bars, privacy settings,
                            deletion features, and tag creation. Though I was new
                            to React and Node at the time, I found that I was
                            able to be successful at my tasks through the time and
                            effort I made to  explore relevant documentation and
                            examples, which made my contributions feel more meaningful.
                            Moreover, our team made use of Scrum practices
                            throughout this project, and I was the Scrum Master
                            for our third Sprint. Directing meetings and managing
                            our Scrum board/other documentation was an excellent
                            experience, and I am very proud of our end result!

                            Wellness applications are common, but
                            only some are both user-friendly and interactive.
                            As my final project for a PY4WEB course (CSE 183),
                            I came up with the idea for such an application
                            and built it in a team of three. Our project
                            allows users to visualize how nutritious their
                            meals are on a virtual plate. This plate can be
                            edited, deleted, and shared with other users.
                            Privacy settings are in place through required
                            account creation/log-in, and plates can be made public
                            or private through a toggle switch. A wide selection of
                            foods are available with customizable quanities,
                            and a search feature with exceptional filtering
                            methods enhances user experience.
                            I created several functionalities, specifically
                            the ones to add food, remove food, update quantities,
                            share the plate, and make the plate public/private.
                            As we continued developing our application, we
                            assisted each other with our tasks and enhanced
                            features as seen fit.

                            but on a special, clear night in Santa Cruz, while
                            I was admiring the hundreds of stars above me, I
                            realized I did not know much about them - their
                            origins, meanings, best viewing period, etc.
                            So, when my data visualization course (CSE 163)
                            required us to tackle topics that interested us
                            for our final project, I knew this would be a
                            great opportunity for me to learn. In a team of four,
                            we mapped all 88 constellations by their best
                            viewability according to month and latitude.
                            In addition to researching databases we could use,
                            I created the time slider, the functionality for
                            filtering the list of constellations by selected
                            latitude region, the functionality for loading/
                            displaying images, and the tooltip contents.
                            I also wrote the majority of the text seen on the
                            page and made the latitude markings along the map.
