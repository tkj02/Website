                            I was curious about electric vehicles due to some
                            recent conversations with relatives. I wanted to
                            determine which brands were most popular/successful
                            and found a dataset on Kaggle that fit my needs.
                            While it had 5000+ relevant entries, it required a
                            great deal of cleaning (converting data, trimming,
                            removing junk characters, creating calculated fields,
                            etc.), which I did through Excel and PostgreSQL.
                            I then used this data to answer inquiries on quarterly
                            sales between 2012 and 2019, which can be seen in
                            ev_sales.sql. A visualization of actual EV sales compared
                            to expected EV sales for the top ten best-selling brands
                            can be seen on Tableau. In the future, I would like to
                            explore brand popularity by customer demographics and
                            compare EV sales to non-EV sales from the same make.

                            I cleaned data on 7000+ films and conducted
                            exploratory analysis using Python's Matplotlib,
                            Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn. Using the Pearson
                            method, I found a positive correlation of 0.74
                            between movie budget and gross revenue.
                            I also created a correlation matrix in the
                            form of a heatmap to visualize this relationship in
                            addition to other relationships between different
                            movie features. This matrix further shows the strong
                            correlation betweewn budget and revenue.

                            I was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and wanted to
                            learn more about the prevalence of thyroid conditions
                            and treatment options across people of different
                            backgrounds. I came across a Kaggle dataset with
                            relevant information, and though it was meant for
                            machine learning projects, I deemed it as a good
                            starting place for my own purpose. From the 9000+
                            patient entries in this dataset, I identified and
                            removed "normal function" patients and cleaned the
                            remaining entries (removed outliers, created calculated
                            fields, converted data, etc.) using PostgreSQL.
                            I then constructed an interactive dashboard on Tableau
                            to visualize my data by age, sex, and treatment option.
                            I found that adult women are most affected and that
                            medication is the most common treatment option.

                            To hone my Excel skills, I followed a tutorial

                            I cleaned data on 1000+ sales, created pivot

                            My four teammates and I saw the need
                            for a free, interactive study tool that
                            would assist students like us. Our project
                            allows users to create flashcards or view
                            other users’ flashcards and quiz themselves
                            through a playable quizzing game. Flashcards
                            are contained in sets, multiple sets are contained
                            in a chapter, and multiple chapters are
                            contained in a course. I worked on both the
                            frontend (React JS) and the backend (Google's
                            Firebase/NoSQL and Neon.tech/PostgreSQL) of this
                            project. More specifically, I developed the
                            sidebar, search bars, course privacy settings,
                            course deletion feature, and tag creation for
                            both courses and chapters. Though most of the
                            technologies we used were new to me at the time,
                            I found that I was able to be successful at my
                            tasks through the time and effort I made to
                            explore relevant documentation and examples.
                            Moreover, our team made use of Scrum practices
                            throughout this project, and I was the Scrum Master
                            for our third Sprint. Directing meetings and managing
                            our Scrum board/other documentation was an excellent
                            experience, and I am very proud of our end result!

                            Wellness applications are common, but
                            only some are both user-friendly and interactive.
                            As my final project for a PY4WEB course (CSE 183),
                            I came up with the idea for such an application
                            and built it in a team of three. Our project
                            allows users to visualize how nutritious their
                            meals are on a virtual plate. This plate can be
                            edited, deleted, and shared. Privacy settings are
                            in place through required account creation/
                            log-in, and plates can be made public or
                            private at any time. A wide selection of
                            foods are available with customizable quanities,
                            and a search feature with exceptional filtering
                            methods enhances user experience.
                            I created several functionalities, specifically
                            the ones to add food, remove food, update quantities,
                            share the plate, and make the plate public/private.
                            As we continued developing our application, we
                            assisted each other with our tasks and enhanced
                            features as seen fit.

                            I have always enjoyed viewing constellations,
                            but on a special, clear night in Santa Cruz, while
                            I was admiring the hundreds of stars above me, I
                            realized I did not know much about them - their
                            origins, meanings, best viewing period, etc.
                            So, when my data visualization course (CSE 163)
                            required us to tackle topics that interested us
                            for our final project, I knew this would be a
                            great opportunity for me to learn. In a team of four,
                            we mapped all 88 constellations by their best
                            viewability according to month and latitude.
                            In addition to researching databases we could use,
                            I created the time slider, the functionality for
                            filtering the list of constellations by selected
                            latitude region, the functionality for loading/
